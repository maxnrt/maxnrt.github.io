The hell you're doing looking at my HTML??? Like who told you you could just come in and snoop around?
lol, lmao even
Now go back to browsing the website (not too much or you'll find mistakes) or I'll start putting funny easter eggs.
wait, does that count as one? Did the egg come first? Is this world even real?
Real or not, web dev is not good and I'd rather knock myself unconscious trying to fix a C++ error

                The Eminence in Shadow is an isekai where the main character, who was in search of strength to the point of insanity, obtains magic.
                There are many characters, all of which have varied backgrounds and traits.

            <p title="Personal opinion of Noiret Maxime on The Eminence in Shadow." class="desc">
                I personally love this anime because the main character just doesn't care about anything but accomplishes many things. He also plays the role of a
                random guy, using his power to enhance his background-characterness. Overall, I recommend <strong>EVERYONE</strong>, including <strong>YOU</strong>
                to watch it. Go. Go watch it. Now. I'm not asking. This is an order.
