                Evangelion: 1.0 You Are (Not) Alone : is a nearly line-for-line, shot-for-shot remake of episodes 1 to 6. 
                Despite the great similarities, some differences are notable, like the introduction of Lilith and a 
                mysterious apparition of Kaworu on the moon.

                is a much looser retelling or re-imagining of episodes 8 through 23. Its differences from these episodes 
                include newly designed creatures and new characters, such as Mari Illustrious Makinami. Asuka is introduced 
                in this film bearing a new surname, and some other differences from her original incarnation.
