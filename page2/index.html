                Evangelion: 1.0 You Are (Not) Alone : is a nearly line-for-line, shot-for-shot remake of episodes 1 to 6. 
                Despite the great similarities, some differences are notable, like the introduction of Lilith and a 
                mysterious apparition of Kaworu on the moon.
            </p>
            <p title="second movie" >
                Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance : continues the story of Evangelion: 1.0 You Are (Not) Alone, and 
                is a much looser retelling or re-imagining of episodes 8 through 23. Its differences from these episodes 
                include newly designed creatures and new characters, such as Mari Illustrious Makinami. Asuka is introduced 
                in this film bearing a new surname, and some other differences from her original incarnation.
            </p>
            <p title="third movie" >
                Evangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo is the first film to completely break from the original continuity and tell
                a completely new story. Taking place fourteen years after the previous events and heavily featuring 
                Kaworu, a new organization called WILLE is introduced and described as a NERV rival. New types of Evas 
                are introduced, as well as new characters such as Sakura Suzuhara, Toji's sister.
            </p>
            <p title="last movie" >    
                Evangelion: 3.0+1.0 Thrice Upon a Time concludes the story. Presented in it are some references 
                from End of Evangelion and some scenes from the original show. It shows the final conflict between NERV 
                and WILLE, as well as between Gendo and Shinji.

        <div title="Theme of the anime">
            <h2 class="flexCenter">Theme of the quadrilogie</h2>
            <p>
                The main theme of the rebuild serie is like the original, loneliness and how to we deal with it. 
                But the Rebuild have a diffrent ending compared to the original serie, a happier one. 
                This new ending reflect the changes of the perception of the creator of the evangelion franchise,  Hideaki Anno, toward loneliness.
