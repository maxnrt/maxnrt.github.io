                Evangelion: 1.0 You Are (Not) Alone : is a nearly line-for-line, shot-for-shot remake of episodes 1 to 6. 
                Despite the great similarities, some differences are notable, like the introduction of Lilith and a 
                mysterious apparition of Kaworu on the moon.
            </p>
            <p title="second movie" id="syno02">
                Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance : continues the story of Evangelion: 1.0 You Are (Not) Alone, and 
                is a much looser retelling or re-imagining of episodes 8 through 23. Its differences from these episodes 
                include newly designed creatures and new characters, such as Mari Illustrious Makinami. Asuka is introduced 
                in this film bearing a new surname, and some other differences from her original incarnation.
            </p>

                a completely new story. Taking place fourteen years after the previous events and heavily featuring 
                Kaworu, a new organization called WILLE is introduced and described as a NERV rival. New types of Evas 
                are introduced, as well as new characters such as Sakura Suzuhara, Toji's sister.
            </p>

                from End of Evangelion and some scenes from the original show. It shows the final conflict between NERV 
                and WILLE, as well as between Gendo and Shinji.

        <div title="Theme of the anime">
            <h2 class="flexCenter">theme of the quadrilogie</h2>
            <p>
                The main theme of the rebuild serie is like the original, loneliness and how to we deal whit it. 
                But the Rebuild have a diffrent ending compared to the original serie, a happier one. 
                This new ending reflect the changes of the perception of the creator of the evangelion franchise,  Hideaki Anno.
